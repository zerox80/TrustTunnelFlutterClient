/// {@template vpn_data_source}
/// Low-level abstraction over the VPN platform/backend.
///
/// `VpnDataSource` represents the closest Dart-side interface to the platform
/// implementation. It exposes:
/// - continuous streams of VPN state and logs,
/// - imperative commands to start and stop the VPN,
/// - a one-shot state request.
///
/// This interface is intentionally minimal and backend-oriented. Higher-level
/// orchestration (restarts, state caching, UI concerns) is expected to be
/// handled by repositories or controllers above this layer.
/// {@endtemplate}
abstract class VpnDataSource {
  /// {@template vpn_data_source_state_stream}
  /// Stream of VPN state updates.
  ///
  /// The stream emits new [VpnState] values whenever the backend reports a state
  /// change. The exact frequency and timing depend on the platform implementation.
  ///
  /// Consumers should assume this stream is:
  /// - single-subscription,
  /// - long-lived for the duration of an active VPN session.
  /// {@endtemplate}
  Stream<VpnState> get vpnState;

  /// {@template vpn_data_source_logs_stream}
  /// Stream of VPN log events.
  ///
  /// Each emitted [VpnLog] represents a single log entry produced by the backend.
  /// Ordering is preserved as provided by the platform.
  /// {@endtemplate}
  Stream<VpnLog> get vpnLogs;

  /// {@template vpn_data_source_start}
  /// Starts the VPN session using the provided configuration inputs.
  ///
  /// Implementations are responsible for:
  /// - translating domain models into backend-specific configuration,
  /// - initiating the VPN engine/service on the platform,
  /// - making state and log streams available.
  ///
  /// This method completes when the start request has been issued to the backend,
  /// not necessarily when the VPN reaches a connected state.

  ///
  /// This method has effect **only on iOS**. On other platforms it is expected
  /// to be a no-op.
  ///
  /// The update is applied to the **system-level VPN configuration** associated
  /// with the provided [server]. As a result, the changes become visible in the
  /// iOS Settings app under the selected VPN profile.
  ///
  /// Implementations are responsible for:
  /// - mapping domain models to the platform-specific configuration format,
  /// - updating the existing VPN profile rather than creating a new one,

  /// to be a no-op.
  ///
  /// The call removes the **system-level VPN profile** previously created or
  /// updated by this data source. As a result, the corresponding VPN entry
  /// disappears from the iOS Settings app.
  ///
  /// This method does not implicitly manage the VPN session lifecycle. If the
  /// VPN tunnel is currently running, implementations are expected to stop the
  /// active session before deleting the configuration, or require the caller
  /// to do so explicitly.
  /// {@endtemplate}

  /// eventually emit [VpnState.disconnected].
  /// {@endtemplate}
