/// - "bypass" rules ([bypassRules]) — destinations that should be handled directly,
/// - "vpn" rules ([vpnRules]) — destinations that should be handled via VPN,

///
/// The rule strings are stored as provided (typically domains, IPs, or CIDR
/// ranges). Validation and normalization, if needed, are expected to happen
/// in upper layers (e.g. when building platform configuration).
