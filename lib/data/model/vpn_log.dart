/// {@template vpn_log}
/// A single VPN log entry produced by the backend.
///
/// `VpnLog` is an immutable data model intended for:
/// - diagnostics,
/// - UI display (connection history / per-request decisions),
/// - exporting or telemetry (if your app supports it).
///
/// ## Field semantics
/// - [action] describes how the engine handled the traffic.
/// - [protocol] indicates the transport protocol.
/// - [timeStamp] is the moment the backend recorded the entry.
/// - [source] and [destination] are backend-formatted endpoint identifiers
///   (commonly `ip:port`).
/// - [domain] is optional and may be absent when the backend cannot associate
///   a domain name with the destination.
///
/// Instances are immutable and use value-based equality.
/// {@endtemplate}
