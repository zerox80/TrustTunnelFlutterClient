/// `RoutingDetailsData` is intended for **UI editing flows** where a user
/// configures routing behavior (for example, creating or editing a routing
/// profile).
///
/// Validation and normalization of rule strings (domains, IPs, CIDR ranges)
/// are expected to be handled by higher layers before persistence or usage
/// in platform configuration.
///
/// ## Field semantics
/// - [defaultMode] defines the primary routing behavior.
/// - [bypassRules] contains destinations that should be routed directly.
/// - [vpnRules] contains destinations that should be routed through the VPN.
///
/// Instances are immutable and use value-based equality.
